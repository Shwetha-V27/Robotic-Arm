# Robotic-Arm
This project presents a robotic arm exoskeleton that mimics human hand movements using servo motors and flex sensors. 
The flex sensors capture finger motions, translating them into real-time movements of the robotic arm. This system enables intuitive and precise control, making it suitable for applications in rehabilitation, assistive technology, and robotic manipulation.
